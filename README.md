#### Description:

Shoppr is the easiest way to keep track of items that you need to buy on your next shopping trip and compare the prices between shops to see where you can get a better deal. In this web app you create your very own account on which your shopping list and history will be kept. Once you are logged in, you are faced with the dashboard which shows how much you spent today and how much you have spent since you have created your account.

### Shopping list

On the shopping list page, you can search the database for an item that you need to buy on your next shopping trip and with the help of Javascript, you do not need to submit to search because when you start typing all the possible options will show up and will keep refreshing after each keystroke. When you find the item you need, you will have an option to add it to the list.

Just below the search box, we have the dynamic shopping list. The list displays the name of the item, the shop the item is sold at, the price (which can be edited in case the item is on a promotion or the price went up) and Action in which you choose to either to indicate that you have bought the item or to delete this item from the list.

### Database

The database is shared across the accounts so an item added by one user can be accesed by another. To add an item to the database you need to complete the form with the required information. You need to enter the name of the item, the brand, the shop that the item is sold at and the current price (this will be the default price that will show up on the shopping list). If the price changes permanantly, you can edit the price directly below the add to database form where all the items will be displayed.

### Receipts

On the receipts page you can view your history of every item you have bought since you opened the Shoppr account. This can be helpful to see how often you buy a certain item or how long it has been since you bought something. The items on the list can be deleted using the red recycle bin button in case an item was marked as bought by accident.
